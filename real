Background
Allow FraudSight report delivery so that Pazien can process the reports



Assumptions
File will be dropped of to us by the FraudSight Team. We must provision access for them as well as provision the infrastructure needed for them to drop off the files.

Solution Assumptions
Utilize an s3 bucket that Pazien will provision for the FraudSight team to drop files into. 

FraudSight team will gain access to s3 bucket via AWS STS Role Assumption (aka - we also need an IAM role for this)

All AWS resources will be provisioned by a Cloudformation Stack

S3 Buckets needed bucket level encryption

S3 Role needs actions to list and drop off files to said bucket

Need to provide ability for Role assumption via STS service.

We will need ARN of FraudSight AWS user

ARN should be a parameter that is passed in to the cloudformation stack

Need separate stacks for Staging vs Production

hint hint - Ensure environment is a parameter that can be passed in and applied to the different resources
